# Ankh-Morpork Scramble — Agent Orientation

This file is the first thing a coding agent should read before touching this project.
It contains current state, active work, upcoming tasks, and conventions.

## Project in one paragraph

A turn-based sports game server (FastAPI + Python) inspired by Blood Bowl, set in Terry
Pratchett's Discworld. Two AI agent teams (City Watch Constables vs. Unseen University
Adepts) play matches autonomously via LLM agents in `simple_agents/`. The game is deployed
on Railway with a persistent volume for leaderboard data. A live dashboard at
`app/web/templates/dashboard.html` polls the server and renders the pitch, team thoughts,
and a structured event log.

## Environment

- Python package manager: `uv` — use `uv run` for all commands
- Tests: `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -q`
- Server: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Game runner: `uv run python run_simple_game.py`
- Railway env vars: `DEMO_MODE=false`, `GAME_ID=the-match`, `DATA_DIR=/data`,
  `TEAM1_MODEL`, `TEAM2_MODEL`, `COMMENTATOR_MODEL` (default: `qwen/qwen3.6-plus:free`),
  `ADMIN_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

## Current state (as of 2026-04-06)

### What's working

- **Full game loop** — agents buy players, deploy, play two halves, game ends, scoreboard
  appears, user clicks "Play Again", runner loops back to setup.

- **Leaderboard** — records win/loss/draw per team and per LLM model to
  `/data/results.jsonl` (persists across redeployments via Railway volume). API at
  `GET /leaderboard`, standalone page at `/leaderboard/ui`, mini-table in post-match
  scoreboard overlay. Model identity stamped via `team1_model`/`team2_model` params on
  `POST /game/{id}/start`.

- **Reachable squares** — BFS flood-fill per player exposed on `GET /valid-actions` as
  `reachable_squares`. Agent prompt uses these to constrain move destinations. Eliminates
  the "Position is occupied" / path-exceeds-MA failure loops.

- **Ghost-occupancy fix** — KO'd, casualty, and sent-off players are removed from
  `pitch.player_positions` after combat. Previously a dead player's position entry blocked
  that square permanently.

- **Smooth pitch animation** — `renderPitch()` uses persistent SVG elements with CSS
  transitions. No more full DOM teardown on every poll. Move flash (keyframe ring), ball
  landing pulse, player fade-in/out.

- **Structured game log** — log renders from `state.events` directly. Four visual tiers
  (landmark/dramatic/action/quiet), inline dice display, filter bar (All/Combat/Ball/
  Turnovers), count badge. Newest events at the top. No separate markdown fetch.

- **Single-screen layout** — viewport-locked (`height:100vh; overflow:hidden`). Pitch
  fills centre column via `flex:1; min-height:0`. Status chips inline in compact header.
  Commentary/Events/Roster tabs below pitch. Team sidebars show treasury + strategy
  messages. Leaderboard link in right sidebar.

- **Referee commentary** — `summarize_for_commentator()` identifies the headline event
  (touchdown > turnover > casualty > ...) and provides structured context (ball carrier,
  score). System prompt requires first sentence to name the action and players.

- **Model tournament pool** — `simple_agents/model_picker.py` picks two distinct models
  per game from a 10-model pool, weighted by `1/(games+1)` so less-played models get
  more games. Manual `TEAM1_MODEL`/`TEAM2_MODEL` env vars override the picker.

- **Agent intelligence** — per-player MA budget visible in state summary, valid-actions
  rendered as natural language, rich failure feedback with retry context, unacted-player
  count so agent knows when to end turn.

### Known failing tests

None. Suite is 279/279 green.

## Active / upcoming work

### Next priorities

1. **Database persistence upgrade** — `data/results.jsonl` survives redeployments via the
   Railway volume, but SQLite would be cleaner for querying and more robust under concurrent
   writes. The volume is already mounted at `/data`. Simple migration: replace
   `LeaderboardStore` internals with `sqlite3` stdlib, keep the same public interface.

## Key data flows

### Game end → leaderboard
1. `end_turn()` in `game_manager.py` transitions phase to `CONCLUDED`
2. `_save_game_logs()` fires → calls `_record_result_if_concluded()`
3. `_record_result_if_concluded()` reads scores and model names, builds `GameResult`,
   calls `leaderboard.record(result)` → appends to `/data/results.jsonl`
4. `POST /game/{id}/rematch` also calls `_record_result_if_concluded()` as belt-and-suspenders
5. `GET /leaderboard` reads JSONL, aggregates in-memory, returns `LeaderboardResponse`

### Agent turn
1. `run_simple_game.py` calls `play_turn()` in `simple_agents/player.py`
2. `play_turn()` fetches `GET /valid-actions` → gets reachable squares per player
3. `summarize_for_player()` builds natural-language context including MA budgets
4. LLM called with context → returns one action JSON
5. Action POSTed to server; on failure, `build_failure_context()` generates retry prompt
6. Repeats until LLM returns null (end turn) or MAX_RETRIES exceeded

## Before every commit — mandatory steps

```bash
# 1. Regenerate docs (catches stale API-REFERENCE, ROSTERS, etc.)
uv run python -m docs_generator.generate

# 2. Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -q

# 3. Commit and push
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push
```

**The CI runs `docs_generator.generate --check` and will fail if docs are stale.**
This happens whenever you: add/change a route in `app/main.py` or `app/web/ui.py`,
change player positions in `app/models/team.py`, or change game mechanics.
Always run step 1 before committing — it's safe to run even if nothing changed.

## Coding conventions

- All new endpoints go in `app/main.py` with a docstring and `response_model`
- Pydantic models in `app/models/` — one file per domain
- No new Python packages without checking `pyproject.toml` first (Railway build)
- No new npm/JS dependencies — vanilla JS only in the dashboard
- Commits: `type(scope): description` — e.g. `feat(leaderboard): add GameResult model`
- Always `git push` after committing so Railway can auto-deploy
- Run tests before committing: `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -q`
